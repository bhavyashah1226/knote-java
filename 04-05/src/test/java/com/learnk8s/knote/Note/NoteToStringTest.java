ROOST_METHOD_SIG_HASH=toString_ceffa8036e

================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-200: Information Exposure
Issue: The 'toString()' method is returning the 'description' field directly. If the 'description' field contains sensitive information, it could be leaked.
Solution: Ensure that sensitive information is not included in the 'description' field. If it is necessary, make sure to sanitize or encrypt the data before returning it.

Vulnerability: CWE-359: Exposure of Private Information ('Privacy Violation')
Issue: The 'toString()' method can be accessed publicly which may lead to exposure of private information.
Solution: Limit the scope of the 'toString()' method to the minimum necessary or ensure it does not return any sensitive information.

Vulnerability: CWE-489: Leftover Debug Code
Issue: If the 'toString()' method is used for debugging purposes, its presence in production code could lead to information exposure.
Solution: Remove debug code or ensure it is deactivated in production environment.

================================================================================
Scenario 1: Test for Valid Description String

Details:
  TestName: testValidDescriptionToString
  Description: This test is meant to check if the toString method returns the correct description string when it is valid.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the class with a valid description string.
  Act: Invoke the toString method on the created instance.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the returned string with the expected description string.
Validation:
  The assertion aims to verify the correctness of the toString method. The expected result is the valid description string, as the toString method is supposed to return the description. This test is significant in ensuring that the toString method works as expected when the description is valid.

Scenario 2: Test for Null Description

Details:
  TestName: testNullDescriptionToString
  Description: This test is meant to check if the toString method returns null when the description is null.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the class with a null description.
  Act: Invoke the toString method on the created instance.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check if the returned string is null.
Validation:
  The assertion aims to verify the behavior of the toString method when the description is null. The expected result is null, as the toString method should return the description, which is null in this case. This test is significant in ensuring that the toString method handles null descriptions correctly.

Scenario 3: Test for Empty Description

Details:
  TestName: testEmptyDescriptionToString
  Description: This test is meant to check if the toString method returns an empty string when the description is empty.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the class with an empty description.
  Act: Invoke the toString method on the created instance.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check if the returned string is empty.
Validation:
  The assertion aims to verify the behavior of the toString method when the description is empty. The expected result is an empty string, as the toString method should return the description, which is empty in this case. This test is significant in ensuring that the toString method handles empty descriptions correctly.
