================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-859: Information Exposure Through an Error Message
Issue: The 'toString' method is returning the description of the Note object. If this description contains sensitive data, it could be exposed in logs or error messages.
Solution: Do not include sensitive data in the 'toString' method. Alternatively, you can implement logging controls to sanitize or exclude sensitive data.

Vulnerability: CWE-598: Information Exposure Through Query Strings in GET Request
Issue: If the 'toString' method is used within a GET request, sensitive information could be exposed through query strings.
Solution: Avoid using the 'toString' method within a GET request if it contains sensitive data. Use POST requests for transmitting sensitive data.

Vulnerability: CWE-489: Leftover Debug Code
Issue: The 'toString' method might be used for debugging and could be accidentally left in the production code, leading to potential information exposure.
Solution: Ensure to remove or disable debugging code in the production environment. Implement a code review process to check for leftover debug code.

"""
Scenario 1: Test to check if the toString method returns the correct description

Details:
  TestName: testToStringReturnsCorrectDescription
  Description: The test is meant to check if the toString method is returning the correct description. This is a positive scenario where the description is expected to be returned correctly.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set up a test instance of the class with a known description.
  Act: Invoke the toString method on the test instance.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the returned value against the known description.
Validation:
  The assertion aims to verify that the toString method correctly returns the description of the class instance. The expected result is that the known description is returned. This is significant as it tests the basic functionality of the toString method.

Scenario 2: Test to check if the toString method handles null description

Details:
  TestName: testToStringHandlesNullDescription
  Description: The test is meant to check if the toString method can handle a null description. This is a negative scenario where the description is null.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set up a test instance of the class with a null description.
  Act: Invoke the toString method on the test instance.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the returned value against null or an appropriate default value.
Validation:
  The assertion aims to verify that the toString method can handle a null description. The expected result is that null or an appropriate default value is returned. This is significant as it tests the robustness of the toString method in handling null values.

Scenario 3: Test to check if the toString method handles empty description

Details:
  TestName: testToStringHandlesEmptyDescription
  Description: The test is meant to check if the toString method can handle an empty description. This is a negative scenario where the description is an empty string.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set up a test instance of the class with an empty description.
  Act: Invoke the toString method on the test instance.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the returned value against an empty string or an appropriate default value.
Validation:
  The assertion aims to verify that the toString method can handle an empty description. The expected result is that an empty string or an appropriate default value is returned. This is significant as it tests the robustness of the toString method in handling empty strings.
