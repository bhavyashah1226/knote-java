================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-200: Information Exposure
Issue: The 'toString()' method is returning the 'description' field directly. If the 'description' field contains sensitive information, it could be leaked.
Solution: Ensure that sensitive information is not included in the 'description' field. If it is necessary, make sure to sanitize or encrypt the data before returning it.

Vulnerability: CWE-359: Exposure of Private Information ('Privacy Violation')
Issue: There are no explicit access modifiers in your class, which means all fields are package-private by default. This could lead to unintended access to the data by classes in the same package.
Solution: Explicitly declare the access level for each field and method in your class. Consider making fields 'private' and providing public 'getter' and 'setter' methods as needed.

Vulnerability: CWE-598: Information Exposure Through Query Strings in GET Request
Issue: If the 'description' field is used in a GET request query string, it could be exposed in web server logs, browser history, or other places where URLs are logged or cached.
Solution: Avoid including sensitive data in GET request query strings. Consider using POST requests to send sensitive data to the server.

================================================================================
Scenario 1: Test for Valid Description String

Details:
  TestName: testValidDescriptionToString
  Description: This test is meant to check if the toString method returns the correct description string when it is valid.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the class with a valid description string.
  Act: Invoke the toString method on the created instance.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the returned string with the expected description string.
Validation:
  The assertion aims to verify the correctness of the toString method. The expected result is the valid description string, as the toString method is supposed to return the description. This test is significant in ensuring that the toString method works as expected when the description is valid.

Scenario 2: Test for Null Description

Details:
  TestName: testNullDescriptionToString
  Description: This test is meant to check if the toString method returns null when the description is null.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the class with a null description.
  Act: Invoke the toString method on the created instance.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check if the returned string is null.
Validation:
  The assertion aims to verify the behavior of the toString method when the description is null. The expected result is null, as the toString method should return the description, which is null in this case. This test is significant in ensuring that the toString method handles null descriptions correctly.

Scenario 3: Test for Empty Description

Details:
  TestName: testEmptyDescriptionToString
  Description: This test is meant to check if the toString method returns an empty string when the description is empty.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the class with an empty description.
  Act: Invoke the toString method on the created instance.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check if the returned string is empty.
Validation:
  The assertion aims to verify the behavior of the toString method when the description is empty. The expected result is an empty string, as the toString method should return the description, which is empty in this case. This test is significant in ensuring that the toString method handles empty descriptions correctly.
