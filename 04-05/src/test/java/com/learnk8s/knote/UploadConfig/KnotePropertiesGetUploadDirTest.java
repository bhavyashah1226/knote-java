================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-494: Download of Code Without Integrity Check
Issue: The code does not verify the integrity of a file after it has been downloaded, which can lead to execution of malicious code.
Solution: Implement a checksum mechanism to verify the integrity of the downloaded files. Use cryptographic hash functions like SHA-256 for this purpose.

Vulnerability: CWE-598: Information Exposure Through Query Strings in GET Request
Issue: Sensitive data might be exposed through query strings in the GET request, as the uploaded directory path could contain sensitive information.
Solution: Avoid passing sensitive data through query strings. Use POST requests to send sensitive data to the server.

Vulnerability: CWE-73: External Control of File Name or Path
Issue: The function getUploadDir() retrieves the path of the upload directory from an external source which can lead to arbitrary file upload and potential remote code execution.
Solution: Avoid using user-supplied input in file paths. If this is unavoidable, ensure that the input is properly sanitized and validated.

"""
  Scenario 1: Test for the correct value of the upload directory

  Details:
    TestName: testGetUploadDirValue.
    Description: This test is meant to check if the 'getUploadDir' method is returning the correct value of the upload directory. The target scenario is when the method is invoked, it should return the current value of the upload directory.
  Execution:
    Arrange: No arrange is required as the method does not take any parameters.
    Act: Invoke the 'getUploadDir' method.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the returned value against the expected upload directory value.
  Validation:
    The assertion aims to verify if the 'getUploadDir' method is correctly fetching the value of the upload directory. The expected result is based on the current value of the upload directory. The significance of the test is to ensure that the method is correctly fetching the value of the upload directory, which is crucial for file upload operations in the application.

  Scenario 2: Test for a null value of the upload directory

  Details:
    TestName: testGetUploadDirForNullValue.
    Description: This test is meant to check if the 'getUploadDir' method is returning null when the upload directory is not set. The target scenario is when the upload directory is null, the method should return null.
  Execution:
    Arrange: No arrange is required as the method does not take any parameters.
    Act: Invoke the 'getUploadDir' method.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check if the returned value is null.
  Validation:
    The assertion aims to verify if the 'getUploadDir' method is returning null when the upload directory is not set. The expected result is null. The significance of the test is to ensure that the method is correctly handling the scenario when the upload directory is not set, which is an edge case in the application's file upload operations.
