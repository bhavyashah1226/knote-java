  Scenario 1: Test for the correct value of the upload directory

  Details:
    TestName: testGetUploadDirValue.
    Description: This test is meant to check if the 'getUploadDir' method is returning the correct value of the upload directory. The target scenario is when the method is invoked, it should return the current value of the upload directory.
  Execution:
    Arrange: No arrange is required as the method does not take any parameters.
    Act: Invoke the 'getUploadDir' method.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the returned value against the expected upload directory value.
  Validation:
    The assertion aims to verify if the 'getUploadDir' method is correctly fetching the value of the upload directory. The expected result is based on the current value of the upload directory. The significance of the test is to ensure that the method is correctly fetching the value of the upload directory, which is crucial for file upload operations in the application.

  Scenario 2: Test for a null value of the upload directory

  Details:
    TestName: testGetUploadDirForNullValue.
    Description: This test is meant to check if the 'getUploadDir' method is returning null when the upload directory is not set. The target scenario is when the upload directory is null, the method should return null.
  Execution:
    Arrange: No arrange is required as the method does not take any parameters.
    Act: Invoke the 'getUploadDir' method.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check if the returned value is null.
  Validation:
    The assertion aims to verify if the 'getUploadDir' method is correctly returning null when the upload directory is not set. The expected result is null. The significance of the test is to ensure that the method is correctly handling the scenario when the upload directory is not set, which is crucial for preventing errors during file upload operations in the application.
