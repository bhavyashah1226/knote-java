================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: Uncontrolled Data Exposure
Issue: The method 'getUploadDir()' returns the value of 'uploadDir' without any control or validation. If 'uploadDir' contains sensitive information, it can be exposed to unauthorized users or systems.
Solution: Implement controls to limit the exposure of sensitive data. You can do this by validating and sanitizing the data returned by 'getUploadDir()'. Also, make sure to apply the principle of least privilege, that is, data should only be accessible to those who need it.

Vulnerability: Missing Access Control
Issue: The method 'getUploadDir()' is public, which means any class can access it. This can lead to unauthorized access to the data returned by this method.
Solution: Review the access modifiers of your methods and variables. If a method or variable does not need to be accessed outside the class, make it private or protected. Also consider using getter and setter methods to control access to your variables.

"""
  Scenario 1: Test for the correct value of the upload directory

  Details:
    TestName: testGetUploadDirValue.
    Description: This test is meant to check if the 'getUploadDir' method is returning the correct value of the upload directory. The target scenario is when the method is invoked, it should return the current value of the upload directory.
  Execution:
    Arrange: No arrange is required as the method does not take any parameters.
    Act: Invoke the 'getUploadDir' method.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the returned value against the expected upload directory value.
  Validation:
    The assertion aims to verify if the 'getUploadDir' method is correctly fetching the value of the upload directory. The expected result is based on the current value of the upload directory. The significance of this test is to ensure that the method is correctly fetching the value of the upload directory, which is crucial in the context of file upload operations in the application.

  Scenario 2: Test for the default value of the upload directory

  Details:
    TestName: testGetUploadDirDefaultValue.
    Description: This test is meant to check if the 'getUploadDir' method is returning the default value of the upload directory when it is not set. The target scenario is when the method is invoked and no value has been set for the upload directory, it should return the default value.
  Execution:
    Arrange: No arrange is required as the method does not take any parameters.
    Act: Invoke the 'getUploadDir' method.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the returned value against the expected default upload directory value.
  Validation:
    The assertion aims to verify if the 'getUploadDir' method is correctly fetching the default value of the upload directory when it is not set. The expected result is based on the default value of the upload directory. The significance of this test is to ensure that the method is correctly handling the scenario when no value has been set for the upload directory, which is important in the context of handling file upload operations in the application.
