  Scenario 1: Test to Check Return Value of getUploadDir Method

  Details:
    TestName: testGetUploadDirReturnValue.
    Description: This test is designed to verify that the getUploadDir method returns the correct upload directory value.
  Execution:
    Arrange: There is no need to set up data or mocks since the method does not take any arguments.
    Act: Call the getUploadDir method.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check if the returned value matches the expected upload directory value.
  Validation:
    This test aims to ensure that the getUploadDir method is correctly retrieving the upload directory value. The expected result is the correct upload directory value. The significance of this test is to ensure that the application can access the correct upload directory for file uploads.

  Scenario 2: Test to Check Null Return Value of getUploadDir Method

  Details:
    TestName: testGetUploadDirNullReturnValue.
    Description: This test is designed to verify that the getUploadDir method returns null if the upload directory value is not set.
  Execution:
    Arrange: No need to arrange data or mocks as the method does not take any parameters.
    Act: Call the getUploadDir method.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check if the returned value is null.
  Validation:
    This test aims to check that the getUploadDir method returns null if the upload directory value is not set. The expected result is null. The significance of this test is to handle the scenario where the upload directory value is not set, preventing potential errors in the application.

  Scenario 3: Test to Check Non-Null Return Value of getUploadDir Method

  Details:
    TestName: testGetUploadDirNonNullReturnValue.
    Description: This test is designed to verify that the getUploadDir method does not return null if the upload directory value is set.
  Execution:
    Arrange: No need to arrange data or mocks as the method does not take any parameters.
    Act: Call the getUploadDir method.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check if the returned value is not null.
  Validation:
    This test aims to check that the getUploadDir method does not return null if the upload directory value is set. The expected result is a non-null value. The significance of this test is to validate that the application can retrieve the upload directory value when it is set.
