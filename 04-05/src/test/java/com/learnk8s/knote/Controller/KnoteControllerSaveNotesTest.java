================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-200: Information Exposure
Issue: Commented out code and debugging statements like 'System.out.println' can unintentionally leak sensitive information if they are not properly removed in the production environment.
Solution: Ensure to remove all debugging statements and commented out code. If logging is needed, use a proper logging library that can be configured to disable certain levels of logging in production.

Vulnerability: CWE-400: Uncontrolled Resource Consumption
Issue: The code does not check the size of the uploaded file. This can lead to Out of Memory (OOM) errors if a large file is uploaded.
Solution: Implement a maximum file size check before processing the file upload.

Vulnerability: CWE-434: Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type
Issue: The code does not check the file type of the uploaded file. This can lead to arbitrary file upload vulnerability if an attacker uploads executable or script files.
Solution: Implement a whitelist of allowed file types and reject all other file types.

Vulnerability: CWE-22: Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')
Issue: Using user provided file name directly without sanitization for file saving can lead to directory traversal attacks. An attacker can provide a file name like '../../etc/passwd' to read sensitive files.
Solution: Always sanitize user inputs before using them in file system operations. Do not directly use user provided strings in file path constructions.

"""
Scenario 1: Test when both upload and publish parameters are null
Details:  
  TestName: testSaveNotesWithNullUploadAndPublish.
  Description: This test is meant to check the functionality when both upload and publish parameters are null. The method should return a BAD_REQUEST status code in this case.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the MultipartFile, description, upload, and publish parameters as null.
  Act: Invoke the saveNotes method with the mocked parameters.
  Assert: Assert that the returned ResponseEntity contains a BAD_REQUEST status code.
Validation: 
  The assertion verifies that the method correctly handles the scenario when both upload and publish parameters are null. It is significant as it validates the method's error handling capability.

Scenario 2: Test when upload is not null and file is valid
Details:  
  TestName: testSaveNotesWithValidUpload.
  Description: This test is meant to check the functionality when the upload parameter is not null and a valid file is provided. The method should process the file and return a CREATED status code.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the MultipartFile with a valid file, provide a non-null upload parameter and a null publish parameter.
  Act: Invoke the saveNotes method with the mocked parameters.
  Assert: Assert that the returned ResponseEntity contains a CREATED status code.
Validation: 
  The assertion verifies that the method correctly handles the scenario of a valid file upload. It is significant as it validates the file processing capability of the method.

Scenario 3: Test when upload is not null but file is invalid
Details:  
  TestName: testSaveNotesWithInvalidUpload.
  Description: This test is meant to check the functionality when the upload parameter is not null but an invalid file is provided. The method should return a BAD_REQUEST status code.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the MultipartFile with an invalid file, provide a non-null upload parameter and a null publish parameter.
  Act: Invoke the saveNotes method with the mocked parameters.
  Assert: Assert that the returned ResponseEntity contains a BAD_REQUEST status code.
Validation: 
  The assertion verifies that the method correctly handles the scenario of an invalid file upload. It is significant as it validates the method's error handling capability.

Scenario 4: Test when publish is not null
Details:  
  TestName: testSaveNotesWithPublish.
  Description: This test is meant to check the functionality when the publish parameter is not null. The method should save the note and return a CREATED status code.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the MultipartFile, provide a null upload parameter and a non-null publish parameter.
  Act: Invoke the saveNotes method with the mocked parameters.
  Assert: Assert that the returned ResponseEntity contains a CREATED status code.
Validation: 
  The assertion verifies that the method correctly handles the scenario of a note publish. It is significant as it validates the note saving capability of the method.
