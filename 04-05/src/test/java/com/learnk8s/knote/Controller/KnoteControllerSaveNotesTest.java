 * """ Scenario 1: Test when both upload and publish parameters are null Details:
 * TestName: testSaveNotesWithNullUploadAndPublish. Description: This test is meant to
 * check the functionality when both upload and publish parameters are null. The method
 * should return a BAD_REQUEST status code in this case. Execution: Arrange: Mock the
 * MultipartFile, description and model parameters. Set both upload and publish parameters
 * to null. Act: Invoke the saveNotes method with the arranged parameters. Assert: Assert
 * that the returned ResponseEntity contains a BAD_REQUEST status code. Validation: The
 * assertion verifies that the method correctly handles the scenario where both upload and
 * publish parameters are null, by returning a BAD_REQUEST status code. This test is
 * significant as it ensures that the method behaves as expected when given invalid
 * parameters.
 *
 * Scenario 2: Test when upload parameter is not null and the file is valid Details:
 * TestName: testSaveNotesWithValidFileUpload. Description: This test is meant to check
 * the functionality when the upload parameter is not null and the file is valid. The
 * method should upload the image and return a CREATED status code in this case.
 * Execution: Arrange: Mock the MultipartFile with a valid file, description, and model
 * parameters. Set the upload parameter to "Upload", and publish parameter to null. Act:
 * Invoke the saveNotes method with the arranged parameters. Assert: Assert that the
 * returned ResponseEntity contains a CREATED status code. Validation: The assertion
 * verifies that the method correctly handles the scenario where the upload parameter is
 * not null and the file is valid, by returning a CREATED status code. This test is
 * significant as it ensures that the method behaves as expected when given valid
 * parameters for uploading a file.
 *
 * Scenario 3: Test when upload parameter is not null but the file is invalid Details:
 * TestName: testSaveNotesWithInvalidFileUpload. Description: This test is meant to check
 * the functionality when the upload parameter is not null but the file is invalid. The
 * method should return a BAD_REQUEST status code in this case. Execution: Arrange: Mock
 * the MultipartFile with an invalid file, description, and model parameters. Set the
 * upload parameter to "Upload", and publish parameter to null. Act: Invoke the saveNotes
 * method with the arranged parameters. Assert: Assert that the returned ResponseEntity
 * contains a BAD_REQUEST status code. Validation: The assertion verifies that the method
 * correctly handles the scenario where the upload parameter is not null but the file is
 * invalid, by returning a BAD_REQUEST status code. This test is significant as it ensures
 * that the method behaves as expected when given invalid file parameters.
 *
 * Scenario 4: Test when publish parameter is not null Details: TestName:
 * testSaveNotesWithPublishParameter. Description: This test is meant to check the
 * functionality when the publish parameter is not null. The method should save the note
 * and return a CREATED status code in this case. Execution: Arrange: Mock the
 * MultipartFile, description, and model parameters. Set the upload parameter to null, and
 * publish parameter to "Publish". Act: Invoke the saveNotes method with the arranged
 * parameters. Assert: Assert that the returned ResponseEntity contains a CREATED status
 * code. Validation: The assertion verifies that the method correctly handles the scenario
 * where the publish parameter is not null, by returning a CREATED status code. This test
 * is significant as it ensures that the method behaves as expected when given valid
 * parameters for publishing a note. """
